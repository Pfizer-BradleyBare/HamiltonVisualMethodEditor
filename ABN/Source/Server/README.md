API:
    GET means requesting data ONLY
    POST means sending data or requesting specific data

Returns:
    Both POST and GET will return JSON object with a status code [True|False], the data received (if successfully parsed) [JSON], and a return [JSON] which contains any other information returned by the request

NOTE: This server implementation does not follow RESTful API due to frustrations with Hamilton software. IE. this is good enough
